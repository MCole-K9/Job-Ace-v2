    At time of writing, I'm not sure that this page should exist. I think it would 
    be better to remove it and replace it with a parameter route for the specific 
    user and their logged actions

    at the same time, knowing the last however many actions, and being able to 
    filter and bound search results seems like a useful feature (but requires 
    more work to plan out)
